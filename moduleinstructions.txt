# Realtek RTL8192CU Monitor Mode Instructions

This will allow you to use your Realtek RTL8192CU (common wireless chip
found in Edimax EDW-7811Un) in monitor mode without recompiling kernel.


### Prerequisites

A few prerequisites are required in order to run the modified drivers. 
To get the files for the drivers, make sure you have Github installed on your machine with...
`sudo apt-get install github`

and wait for it to install. Once installed, the command to gather the drivers from Github is...
`git clone https://github.com/lwfinger/rtlwifi_new` while in the directory you want your files installed to.

Do _NOT_ install the Makefile; it will throw an error on the Raspberry Pi, due to it being an ARM CPU/SoC.
That is the big reason you need to recompile a kernel to get the drivers that are included with an OS like Kali Linux
that natively support the monitor mode on these chips. With this method however, we can trick Linux into thinking that it has the
correct drivers.



###Install/Blacklisting.

1. In a blank terminal, type `uname -a' and note the kernel version.
..*Make sure to write it down, you will need it in the next step.

2. Navigate using `cd` to `/lib/modules/_Kernel Version_/kernel/drivers/net/wireless/realtek.`
..*Copy that path that you made, you will need it later.
..*Make sure that you see a directory with the name "rtl8192.cu."

3. Now just type plain `cd` to send you back to the home folder. Now, `cd` into `/etc/modprobe.d` and sudo open in your editor of choice
the `blacklist.conf` file.
..*If none exists, just make one.

4. Type `blacklist rtl8192.conf` to block the RTL8192 driver from being used.
